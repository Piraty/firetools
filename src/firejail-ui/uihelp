Firejail is a SUID program that reduces the risk of security breaches by restricting the running environment
of untrusted applications using Linux namespaces and seccomp-bpf. 
The sandbox doesn't implement any security feature in user space.  
Instead, it configures a number of advanced security features inside the kernel and quietly goes to sleep. 
Programs running inside such a sandbox have a very limited view of the system, 
and are heavily restricted.<br/><br/>
<br/><b>Filesystem</b><br/><br/>
The user home directory contains all personal user files, 
including text documents, music, pictures and videos. It also contains 
browser history and bookmarks, passwords, encryption keys and other 
highly sensitive files.<br/><br/>
In a Linux system, the content of a user's home directory is protected by 
filesystem permissions, and is accessible to all authenticated users and administrators. 
The directory is also accessible to any crook taking control of 
a user process. By default, Firejail denies access to some of the most sensitive files 
such as password and encryption keys. This can be enhanced by checking <i>Restrict home directory</i> 
in the left pane, and choosing what directories are visible in the right pane.<br/>
<blockquote>
<i><b>Restrict home directory:</b> Choose the directories visible inside the sandbox. 
By default, with the exception of some well-known password and encryption files, 
all home files and directories are available inside the sandbox.:</i><br/><br/>
</blockquote>
Any other file or directory can be restricted in the command line version of Firejail. 
We provide here only a small number of more common options. We believe these options will work 
for most applications.<br/>
<blockquote>
<i><b>Restrict /dev directory:</b> A small number of very basic devices are visible inside the sandbox. 
Sound and 3D acceleration should also be available if this checkbox is set.<br/><br/>
<b>Restrict /tmp directory:</b> Start with a clean /tmp directory, only X11 directory is available 
there.<br/><br/>
<b>Restrict /mnt and /media:</b> Blacklist /mnt and /media directories.:</i><br/><br/>
</blockquote>
Introduced in Linux kernel version 3.18, OverlayFS provides an elegant way to protect 
the filesystem against modifications: the changes are only visible inside the sandbox, and 
are discarded when the sandbox is closed. This option could be used to test new software, 
try new browser addons etc.<br/>
<blockquote>
<i><b>OverlayFS:</b>This option mounts an overlay filesystem on top of the sandbox. 
Filesystem modification are discarded when the sandbox is closed. 
A kernel 3.18 or newer is required by this option to work.</i><br/><br/>
</blockquote>
<b>Networking</b><br/><br/>
<blockquote>
<i>System network:</i> Use the networking stack provided by the system.<br/><br/>
<i>Network namespace:</i> Install a separate networking stack.<br/><br/>
<i>Disable networking:</i> No network connectivity is available inside the sandbox.<br/><br/>
</blockquote>
<b>Multimedia</b><br/><br/>
<blockquote>
<i>Disable sound:</i> The sound subsystem is not available inside the sandbox.<br/><br/>
<i>Disable 3D acceleration:</i> Hardware acceleration drivers are disabled.<br/><br/>
<i>Disable X11:</i> X11 graphical user interface subsystem is disabled. 
Use this option when running console programs or servers.<br/><br/>
</blockquote>
<b>Kernel</b><br/><br/>
<blockquote>
<i>seccomp, capabilities, nonewprivs:</i> These are some very powerful security features 
implemented by the kernel. A Linux Kernel version 3.5 is required for this option to work.<br/><br/>
<i>AppArmor:</i> If AppArmor is configured and running on  your system, this option implements a number 
of advanced security features inspired by GrSecurity kernels. Also, on 
Ubuntu 16.04 or later, this option disables dBus access.<br/><br/>
